# Galactic-Magnetic-Field-Explorer
JF-12 Magnetic Field Explorer (a side project of arxiv.2303.15562)


Author: K.K.Liao

--- A side project of Relic Neutrino Helicity Evolution in GMF

( arxiv.2303.15562 -- simulating the evolution of the helicity of relic neutrinos as they propagate to Earth through a realistic model of the Galactic magnetic field )

--- The script provides Python script to study the JF-12 Magnetic Field numerical model.
Specifically the magnetic Field magnitude perpendicular to the Line of Sight (LOS) over the sky in discrete pixels for astrophysics research.


Required Package: 
Numpy, Healpy, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas
